# Implementation evidence

This log distinguishes implemented software from accepted delivery targets.
No hardware, application, release distribution or conformance claim is made.

## Foundation — 2026-09-15

Implemented: inert root Mix package, Apache-2.0 license/notices, contribution and
security guidance, bounded redacted error contract, duplicate-preserving YAML
catalogue validation, evidence/reference/delivery graph checks and local links.
The configured local gate runs formatting, warnings-as-errors compilation, full
ExUnit plus 95% coverage, strict Credo, Dialyzer, warnings-as-errors ExDoc,
dependency audit, unused lock entries and dependency license review.

Verification environment: Darwin arm64. Required lanes are Elixir 1.18.4 /
OTP 27.3.4.15 and Elixir 1.20.4 / OTP 29.0.4. Both complete local gates passed:
7 tests, 0 failures, 100% production line coverage; compiler, formatter, strict
Credo, Dialyzer, docs, catalogue/links, dependency audit/licenses, unused lock
entries and archive inspection passed. Commands use `MIX_ENV=test`, with the
newer lane isolated under `MIX_BUILD_PATH=_build/otp29/test`. Third-party test
and documentation dependencies emit deprecation warnings on their initial OTP 29
compilation; no suppression was added. Root warnings-as-errors compilation passes.
The only core runtime dependency is `wotex` plus OTP crypto. Development uses
`WOTEX_PATH_DEPS=1` with `../wotex` at
`eadc6c9f9c285faf9324b8a7396a001381098b6c` (clean at inspection).
Other dependencies are pinned in `mix.lock`; yamerl's historical `BSD 2-Clause`
label was checked against its LICENSE and normalized to SPDX `BSD-2-Clause`.

`mix hex.build` succeeds without the development switch. Its inspected manifest
contains the explicit root library, documentation, license/notices and model
directory, excluding hosts, dependencies, build state, tests and private inputs.
The metadata requires ordinary `wotex ~> 0.1.0`; no path dependency is published.

Unpassed gates: `https://hex.pm/api/packages/wotex` returned HTTP 404 on this date.
Locked/fresh/minimum published-package consumers cannot resolve the required
release. Source-cohort checks cannot establish published-package compatibility.
No production path switch or dependency-constraint override is allowed.

The current `wotex_ble` public API provides connected GATT discovery, with no
passive advertisement scanning entry point. Live BLE is blocked on that upstream
contract plus qualified controller/hardware evidence. Imported observations do
not depend on a scanner. No sibling repository was modified.
