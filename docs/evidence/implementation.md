# Implementation evidence

This log distinguishes implemented software from accepted delivery targets.
No hardware, application, release distribution or conformance claim is made.

## Foundation — 2026-09-15

Implemented: inert root Mix package, Apache-2.0 license/notices, contribution and
security guidance, bounded redacted error contract, duplicate-preserving YAML
catalogue validation, evidence/reference/delivery graph checks and local links.
The configured local gate runs formatting, warnings-as-errors compilation, full
ExUnit plus 95% coverage, strict Credo, Dialyzer, warnings-as-errors ExDoc,
dependency audit, unused lock entries and dependency license review.

Verification environment: Darwin arm64. Required lanes are Elixir 1.18.4 /
OTP 27.3.4.15 and Elixir 1.20.4 / OTP 29.0.4. Both complete local gates passed:
7 tests, 0 failures, 100% production line coverage; compiler, formatter, strict
Credo, Dialyzer, docs, catalogue/links, dependency audit/licenses, unused lock
entries and archive inspection passed. Commands use `MIX_ENV=test`, with the
newer lane isolated under `MIX_BUILD_PATH=_build/otp29/test`. Third-party test
and documentation dependencies emit deprecation warnings on their initial OTP 29
compilation; no suppression was added. Root warnings-as-errors compilation passes.
The only core runtime dependency is `wotex` plus OTP crypto. Development uses
`WOTEX_PATH_DEPS=1` with `../wotex` at
`eadc6c9f9c285faf9324b8a7396a001381098b6c` (clean at inspection).
Other dependencies are pinned in `mix.lock`; yamerl's historical `BSD 2-Clause`
label was checked against its LICENSE and normalized to SPDX `BSD-2-Clause`.

`mix hex.build` succeeds without the development switch. Its inspected manifest
contains the explicit root library, documentation, license/notices and model
directory, excluding hosts, dependencies, build state, tests and private inputs.
The metadata requires ordinary `wotex ~> 0.1.0`; no path dependency is published.

Unpassed gates: `https://hex.pm/api/packages/wotex` returned HTTP 404 on this date.
Locked/fresh/minimum published-package consumers cannot resolve the required
release. Source-cohort checks cannot establish published-package compatibility.
No production path switch or dependency-constraint override is allowed.

The current `wotex_ble` public API provides connected GATT discovery, with no
passive advertisement scanning entry point. Live BLE is blocked on that upstream
contract plus qualified controller/hardware evidence. Imported observations do
not depend on a scanner. No sibling repository was modified.

## WTR.01 software values — 2026-09-15

Implemented bounded Observation, Evidence, EvidenceBundle, Identity and Limits
values. See [the API guide](../guides/observations.md). Native JSON and canonical
Base64 exports preserve type identity. Complete content digests, explicit
UUIDv4 pseudonymous associations, strict duplicate handling, bounded graph
lineage and aggregate claim admission are exercised independently of profiles.

Both required runtime lanes passed with 2 properties and 20 tests, 0 failures,
99.5% production line coverage. Each ran all configured checks and inspected
archive contents. The upstream source revision remained unchanged and clean.
No profile resolution, decoder, TD pipeline, live adapter or hardware is claimed
by this slice. Published-package consumer gates remain unpassed as above.

## WTR.02 resolution and WTR.03 profile values — 2026-09-15

Implemented closed declarative predicates, immutable DeviceProfile/Catalogue and
Resolution values. See [the profile guide](../guides/profiles.md). Matching retains
all candidates, rejects exhaustion, preserves equal-best ambiguity and does not
invoke decoders. Weak name/radio evidence cannot create an eligible profile.

Both required runtime lanes passed the complete local gate: 3 properties and
25 tests, 0 failures, 99.7% production line coverage. Cases include 255/256/257
profiles, 31/32/33 predicates, candidate overflow, full revision identity,
permutations, strict numeric matching, escaped pointers and forged selections.

An elapsed-time diagnostic on the floor runtime used 256 profiles, 32 identical
predicates each and 50,000 bytes of source metadata. Setup was excluded; zero
warmup, one caller, five sequential samples. Before removing repeated admission
from internal predicate execution, samples were 1,511,096–1,574,702 microseconds;
afterwards 56,166–62,081 microseconds. Public boundaries still admit complete
inputs. Reproduce the latter using `scripts/bench_resolution.exs` with `MIX_ENV=test`.
These are diagnostic timings, not an SLA, allocation measurement or peak RSS.

Capabilities, profile-specific decoding, materialisation and hardware remain
subsequent acceptance work. No new protocol integration or release compatibility
is claimed by this batch.
