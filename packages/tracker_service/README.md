# Tracker service components

Explicitly started service components live here. Loading this package starts no
Tracker listener or store. The pure `wotex_tracker` package has no dependency on
this package. The durable-store contract and current acceptance scope are in
the repository's `docs/contracts/service-v1.md`.

Development uses `WOTEX_PATH_DEPS=1 MIX_ENV=test mise exec -- mix check --no-retry`
from this directory. Production resolves normal package artifacts. The local
workspace switch is rejected in production.
